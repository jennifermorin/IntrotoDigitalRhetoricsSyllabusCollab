# Introduction to Digital Cultural Rhetorics  
#### Credit Hours: 3 Units

## Course Description
This course introduces students to digital cultural rhetorics. We will critically examine how arguments are made and conveyed in digital cultural texts. We will investigate the collection and uses of digital data in the rhetoric of social-media platforms, online activisms, digitally-constructed identities, and more. We will consider how our everyday research practices with resources like Google and Wikipedia influence the kinds of arguments we make and how we evaluate the arguments of others. Students will apply their knowledge of digital rhetorical theories and design principles through a variety of hands-on projects, regardless of how much digital or technological experience they come in with.

## Course Objectives
In this course, students will:

* Understand basic theories and principles of digital rhetoric
* Examine ethical issues surrounding digital research, arguments, and data collection
* Critically examine and evaluate digital resources, evidence, and arguments
* Situate and be able to discuss digital arguments within larger social, cultural, and theoretical frameworks
* Discuss the relationships between our digital practices and their larger cultural implications, with special attention to contexts such as race & ethnicity, gender, class, ability, and more
* Construct their own digitally-based arguments that are anchored in sound rhetorical practices, while demonstrating competency with technology for designing and distributing digital works

## Course Work

**Data and Culture project: Wikipedia Analysis and Contribution:** Due Week 9

Analyze and update an existing Wikipedia entry: evaluate rhetorical elements and make at least one contribution to page content. Explain your contribution in a short discussion post.

**Design Thinking project: Platform Critique and Recommendations:** Due Week 12

Examine the features, affordances, and constraints of a digital platform. You may select the same platform from the first project or a different one. Assess its cultural impact and recommend improvements and updates through implementation of design practices.

**Final Portfolio and Reflection:** Due Week 15

Develop a digital portfolio that showcases project work developed throughout the course this semester. Include a reflection evaluating what you have learned that also describes how, through your own personal actions as both a user and developer you will build a better world, a world where many worlds fit; linked worlds of collective liberation and ecological sustainability. source: Constanza-Chock's Design Justice
